This project has a somewhat chaotic commit history. One reason is that I think I might have taken "Commit early, commit often" a bit too literally. Another reason is that I went from trying to do version 1.0 to doing version 2.0 without realizing it. Therefore the commit history of this project is a bit chaotic.

Even tho it might have gone wild all by it's own, but I'm very proud of my result. I think the most important thing that I learned is to not stray from the version 1.0 plan before version 1.0 is completed. Also I definitely need to remember to check that everything works before commit.
